# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹  

## About Me  
Hi there! I'm passionate about **Numerical Analysis**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Backend Development**.  

Outside of tech, I focus on maintaining a **healthy lifestyle**â€”whether it's hitting the gym or fueling my personal growth through self-development books.  
When I'm not coding or working out, I love immersing myself in **anime** and **action movies**.  

Feel free to connect if you share similar interests or want to collaborate on exciting projects!  

## My Projects  
- **Python Backends:**  
  - [Backend Project 1: Sistema X-Men](https://github.com/JonasMelo21/Sistema-X-Men.git)  
    A CRUD system for the **Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters** (yes, the X-Men!). This project manages students, teachers, teams, classes, and missions, bringing the X-Men universe to life.  

  - [Backend Project 2: TaskMaster](https://github.com/JonasMelo21/TaskMaster.git)  
    A powerful project/task management application developed collaboratively. It helps users organize their projects, prioritize tasks, associate checklists, and even collaborate with team members or collaborators.  

- **Numerical Analysis Repository:**  
  A dedicated space where I document my learning journey through the book _Numerical Analysis_ by Richard L. Burden and Douglas J. Faires.
